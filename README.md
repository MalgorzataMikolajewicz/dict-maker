# dict-maker
The application creates a dictionary in XLSX containing various time periods (year, half year, quater, MAT, YTD, rolling quater) basing on user input - year/month entered in the field in the pop-up window. I also open a window and ask to put there the files to proceed them in the future (to translate them with created dictionary, for example).
